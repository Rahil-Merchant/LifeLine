# LifeLine

Lifeline is a blood donation app which helps volunteer blood donors to find hospitals in their vicinity to donate blood. Apart from this, the user can also choose to get their blood report generated; by
paying online, getting their blood tested, and getting their report on the app.
With incentives and rewards for frequent donors, LifeLine makes blood donation worthwhile.
